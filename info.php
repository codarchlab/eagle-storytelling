	<h1>Eagle Storytelling Application</h1>
	<p>
		The Flagship Storytelling Application (FSA) is a web-based tool designed to allow users to 
		create multimedia narratives on epigraphic content and share them on the web.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the help of a friendly interface, users are able to write texts and include content in different 
		format into their narratives. In particular, the FSA is designed so as to help authors with special interest 
		in epigraphy and in ancient history or archaeology to get easy access to the main resources for multimedia 
		content on the Ancient World. With the FSA we intend to create a tool that will ultimately enable users 
		to include images and videos from popular hosts (such as YouTube or Europeana), excerpts from Ancient texts, 
		maps locating ancient places and, especially, the vast collection of inscriptions from the EAGLE network.
	</p>
	<p>
		The FSA is thus a useful resource to spread the knowledge about monuments and inscriptions in the collections of 
		the EAGLE network, or to suggest unexplored paths through themes and objects. All the users of the EAGLE services, 
		the members of the EAGLE Best Practices Network and the whole community of persons interested in cultural heritage 
		and history, whether specialists or amateurs, are encouraged to unleash their creativity and experiment with the 
		potential of this tool.
	</p>
	<h2>Tutorial</h2>
	<p>
		By default, all the embedded contents (excerpts from Wikipedia pages, interactive maps or objects from the EAGLE 
		collection or Europeana) are displayed in a compact view. By clicking on the buttons, an excerpt can be expanded 
		(downward arrow at the bottom of the item) and visualized in its original web page (the eye icon on the top-right corner). 
		Finally, you can search for all the stories that embed the same item in our EAGLE collection.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Try it yourself!</strong> Here is a <strong>map</strong> of Berlin. When you expand it using the downward arrow, the interactive map will become available for browsing!<br>

		<br>Here is an <strong>inscription</strong> from the huge EAGLE collection.<br>

		<br>And finally, here is a Wikipedia page: the first paragraph of the embedded voice from the free encyclopedia is reported. Of course, by clicking on the eye you can continue reading the page in its original context.<br>

	<h2>What is the "Epidoc reader"?</h4>
	<p>
		EAGLE is very proud of putting together the largest collection of Graeco-Roman digitized inscriptions on the web. Moreover, we're promoting the use of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/epidoc/wiki/Home/">EpiDoc</a> as a standard for the digital encoding of epigraphic content.<br>
		If you want to make reference to an inscription that is published in the web in EpiDoc format but it's not included in our collection, our Storytelling App is the right tool! Just launch click on "Add Media" from within the editor, select the <strong>EAGLE Storytelling Application</strong>  gallery (just like for any other content) and then click on the <strong>Epidoc</strong> tab.<br>
		Paste the URL of the XML edition of the inscription you want to insert in the search bar and hit the "Search" button. If you want, the App will suggest a series of repositories where you can find EpiDoc xml. The result will look something like this (from <a href="http://iospe.kcl.ac.uk/index.html">IOSPE, Ancient Inscriptions of the Northern Black Sea</a>):<br>
